# todo-basic

Basic todo app with minimal functionality following [this tutorial](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/build-a-simple-todo-app-with-react-561579b39ad1).

Key Learning Points:
- It might be easier to code every component in App.js first before breaking them up into individual components.
- `state` can either be a class property or within a constructor, it is a matter of personal preference. However, the constructor allows `props` to be passed down from parents, and also binds `this`.
- Methods should be in higher lever classes as much as possible.
- Bulma is a good and lightweight alternative to bootstrap
